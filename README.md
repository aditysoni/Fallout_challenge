# Second_ETHURNUT_CHALLENGE
Second ethernut challenge in which you have to change the owner to yourself .

In solidity 0.6 we have to declare constructor by 


function _name_of_the_contract () 
{}

And here in the contract there is a function which is fal1out instead of fallout.
So we create an interface and load the interface at the contract address and call this fal1out.
And we called the function which evenutally make us the owner .
